This is a web app, built in Meteor, to keep track of your media - or at least that's the end goal. Right now it's on its very initial stages towards that. I'll likely be updating this frequently.

Some things work, some things don't. I'm always working on this project and updating it as I learn more. If you find any bugs or anything you see that can be done better, feel free to submit.

This also uses GuessIt. So you'll need to install and run it: https://github.com/guessit-io/guessit-rest The link for api requests is hardcoded for localhost currently, so you'll need to change it if you do an api request to a remote server.
